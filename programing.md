#Programing

I have worked and practiced in many different coding programs such as *Python*, *Atom*, *html*, *game maker studio 2*. My most skilled program
and the one I would say I am most skilled in is *game maker studio 2* since I have been using it the longest. I have created many differnent games
ranging across many genres such as fps, strategy, puzzle, rpg, and adventure games.

##example code from python

**THIS CODE CREATES A TURTLE GRAPHIC IMGAGE**

from turtle import *
color('red', 'yellow')
begin_fill()
while True:
    forward(200)
    left(170)
    if abs(pos()) < 1:
        break
end_fill()
done()
