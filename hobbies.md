## Outdoors ##
- Oceans
- Mountains
- Lakes & Rivers

I very much enjoy spending time at any of these locations. It is great to really imerse yourself into the outdoors and really take in the beauty of it all. When you
are looking from a top a mountain after a long hike is such a amazing feeling. But, My most favorite natural phenomenon tough has to be water. I find water so 
fascinating because It can be so calm and peacful like at *Lake Tahoe* where the water is crstal clear, but it can also be powerful and destructive such as tsunami 
and hurricanes.

## Video Games ##
I have been playing video games for my entire life, I've played on consoles such as gamecube, wii, playstation 4, xbox 360, and xbox one. I have always gotten lost in
games and found them to be so exilerating. I enjoy a lot of RPG(Role-Playing games) such as assassins creed saga, skyrim, e.t.c. as well as first person shooters like
call of duty, titanfall, battefield, battlefront e.t.c.
